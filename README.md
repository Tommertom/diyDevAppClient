# diyDevAppClient - Demonstrating the diyDevApp

Git clone the repository, run npm i, and then ionic serve.

Use diyDevApp to discover the server and see how the plugins work on your device 

Android only tested

And btw, do you see that config.xml actually doesn't show the plugins?  Only npm of ionic-native needed for now.
